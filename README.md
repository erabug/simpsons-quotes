simpsons-quotes
===============

I created an R script to scrape scripts of Simpsons episodes, clean the text, and organize/generate quotes.

My goal is to create a database of quotes from as many seasons as I can. Then, I'll make simple webpage that will allow users to search for specific quotes (by season, episode, and speakers) or generate a random quote from the database.
